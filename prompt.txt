You are an AI planner for the Blocks World problem. Your task is to generate a correct sequence of actions that transforms an initial state of blocks into a goal state.

---

### **Rules & Constraints**
- **Only one block can be moved at a time.**
- **A block can only be picked up if it is clear (i.e., no block is on top of it).**
- **A block can only be stacked onto another block if that block is clear.**
- **You may not move a block that is currently being held.**
- **The hand must be empty before picking up another block.**
- **You must not include invalid actions.** If a move is invalid, reconsider the sequence.

---

### **Initial State**
- The robot's hand is empty.
- The blocks are stacked as follows:
	•	10 is on 9
	•	9 is on 8
	•	8 is on 7
	•	7 is on 6
	•	6 is on 5
	•	5 is on 4
	•	4 is on 3
	•	3 is on 2
	•	2 is on 1
	•	1 is on the table

---

### **Goal State**
- The blocks should be arranged as follows:
	•	1 is on 2
	•	2 is on 3
	•	3 is on 4
	•	4 is on 5
	•	5 is on 6
	•	6 is on 7
	•	7 is on 8
	•	8 is on 9
	•	9 is on 10
	•	10 is on the table

---

### **Available Actions**
1. `unstack(x, y)`: Pick up block `x` from block `y`, given that `x` is **clear** and the **hand is empty**.
2. `put-down(x)`: Place block `x` on the **table**, given that the **hand is holding `x`**.
3. `pick-up(x)`: Pick up block `x` from the **table**, given that `x` is **clear**, the **hand is empty**, and `x` is **directly on the table**.
4. `stack(x, y)`: Stack block `x` on block `y`, given that `x` is **in hand** and `y` is **clear**.

---

### **Example of a Correct Plan**
The following is an **example of a correct plan** for a similar problem where:
- **Initial State:** Blocks are arranged as `3 2 1` (where 3 is on 2, and 2 is on 1).
- **Goal State:** Blocks should be arranged as `1 2 3` (where 1 is on the table, 2 is on 1, and 3 is on 2).

### **Important Formatting Instructions**
	•	Only output the action sequence.
	•	Do not include any explanations, introductions, or additional text.
	•	Do not format your response as a code block.
	•	Each action should be on a separate line.
	•	Strictly follow this format:

unstack(3,2)
put-down(3)
unstack(2,1)
stack(2,3)
pick-up(1)
stack(1,2)
